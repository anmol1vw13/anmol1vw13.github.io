<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">An easy and clear trek, Rayakottai is best for beginners. With a fort on the hilltop, it&nbsp;is one of the ancient fortresses in the Krishnagiri district.&nbsp;In the 18th century, Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan ruled this fort and is now one of the&nbsp;protected monuments of the Archaeological Survey of India.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Although it is just at a distance of 80 kms from Bangalore, the place isn't crowded at all.&nbsp;</div><div>Thanks to the TamilNadu road tax, which is very high!&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b><i>Baseline</i></b></div><div>Crew members: Anmol, Triyansha, Rishabh</div><div>Start time: 7AM</div><div>Transportation: Traveller via BMC (Bangalore Mountaineering Club)</div><div><br /></div><div>We were going to have a long weekend and since I was already on a trek fever, trekking was a natural choice. This time I began the planning on Wednesday. I went up to Ponkishore but he had other plans (home calling!). He suggested to try tagging along with a trekking group for a change and sent me a link to the <a href="https://bmcindia.org/" target="_blank">Bangalore Mountaineering Club</a>.&nbsp;</div><div>The weekend fixed departure section had some really interesting places but since I wanted to start the long weekend off with a trek, I chose the one on Friday.&nbsp;</div><div>After booking my ticket I randomly asked a colleague (Rishabh) and my cousin (Triyansha); she had recently moved to Bangalore. Dono maan gye!!! I booked their tickets as well and we were set for the long weekend.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Getting there</b></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div>BMC has a lot of pickup points, SO IT'S QUITE CONVENIENT.&nbsp;</div><div>7AM was the time given to us and Boy, they were punctual!&nbsp;</div><div>However, within an hour's drive, they halted for breakfast at a Udupi restaurant, when we should have had started the trek by 8!</div><div><br /></div><div>The service was super slow and it took 45mins for everyone to be done with their breakfast. We were a group of 21 people! We were also given our lunch packs (Pulav).</div><div>I dozed off the moment we got into the Traveller. After about an hour, I got up, hoping we were at the destination. But nooooo, we were on the service road, waiting for the driver and the organizers.&nbsp;</div><div>My word of advice, do not travel to Tamil Nadu on the 1st of November. There was a heavy queue at the Tamil Nadu RTO for the road tax.&nbsp;</div><div>We were scheduled to reach the spot by 9AM, but we reached at 11 instead. The sun was bright and the heat was unbearable.</div><div>Nevertheless, the instructor huddled us and briefed us about the fort and the guidelines for the trek.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ap3oM65fMo0/Xe8-FP5fqAI/AAAAAAAAcaw/KwjKhPhdVJQDrospmXsgWbyPu9ktEldxACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/IMG_20191101_104535.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ap3oM65fMo0/Xe8-FP5fqAI/AAAAAAAAcaw/KwjKhPhdVJQDrospmXsgWbyPu9ktEldxACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/IMG_20191101_104535.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>We started trekking at around 11:15 AM.
