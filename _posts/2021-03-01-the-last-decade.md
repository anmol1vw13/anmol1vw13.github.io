In class 12
This was the year of preparation and competitive examinations. 
Cracking it with a good rank was all I had my focus on.
Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Fiitjee internal exams and All India Test Series, the travel from home to fiitjee and back (about 60kms) was all that was going on in my life.

IITJEE, AIEEE, BITS and EAMCET were all the competitive examinations I had given.
Not being able to crack IITJEE was heartbreaking but a decent rank in AIEEE, sure was calming.

Next came in the admission counselling period. 
Since IIT was out of the picture, getting into a top NIT and in a decent branch was the only aim. Didn't have any goal per se w.r.t the course I wanted.
I had only applied for the top 3 NITs at that point of time (Surathkal, Warangal, Trichy) hoping to bag one fairly easily with a rank of 7662. 
And boy was I wrong! Took me 5 rounds to finally register a seat in NIT Surathkal -  the college with an enticing campus and a private beach!
I'm so thankful for the internal sliding that happened which got my branch switched to IT. 
Chemical Engineering surely would have been taxing and I wouldn't be living the life I'm having at present if it weren't for the switch!

This was the year, I met people who I would cherish for life. (Pranav, Moga, Babes, Kalmaadi, Pappu)

I still remember the day 1, when I was going around the hostel, door to door
introducing myself and striking a conversation by asking them their AIEEE ranks (such a dork)

Within a short span of time we became good friends and did almost everything together. I said almost! :P
Going to the classes, bunking them, going to the computer center a.k.a CCC to download the movies, watching them, b'day celebrations
with the infamous GPL, pulling each other's legs, late night group discussions, just to name a few.

This was also the year, Moga had come to me to persuade me to attempt the examination of IITJEE again, because apparently it was THE Dream to study in an IIT.
His just wanted company and didn't want to do it alone. I sadly gave into my emotions and yes, I gave another failed attempt! 
My AIR in AIEEE although shot up from 7662 to 4183 which was a good feeling xD

By the time I turned 18, I was in second year!
