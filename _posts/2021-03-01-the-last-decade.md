In class 12
This was the year of preparation and competitive examinations. 
Cracking it with a good rank was all I had my focus on.
Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Fiitjee internal exams and All India Test Series, the travel from home to fiitjee and back (about 60kms) was all that was going on in my life.

IITJEE, AIEEE, BITS and EAMCET were all the competitive examinations I had given.
Not being able to crack IITJEE was heartbreaking but a decent rank in AIEEE, sure was calming.

Next came in the admission counselling period. 
Since IIT was out of the picture, getting into a top NIT and in a decent branch was the only aim. Didn't have any goal per se w.r.t the course I wanted.
I had only applied for the top 3 NITs at that point of time (Surathkal, Warangal, Trichy) hoping to bag one fairly easily with a rank of 7662. 
And boy was I wrong! Took me 5 rounds to finally register a seat in NIT Surathkal -  the college with an enticing campus and a private beach!
I'm so thankful for the internal sliding that happened which got my branch switched to IT. Chemical Engineering surely would have been a pain and 
I wouldn't be living the life I'm having at present if it weren't for the switch!
