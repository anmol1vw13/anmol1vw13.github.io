<p>I had recently gotten engaged and valentine's was around the corner. 🙈</p>

<p>To make it memorable, I decided to get her something exclusive.</p>

<p>My sister then got to know from a friend of her's about a valentine edition Nike sneaker,
which was going to be launched soon.</p>

<div class="post-img">

</div>

<p>I loved the idea of gifting a limited edition shoe. Since I had never purchased one myself before, the excitement to bag it was obvious.
  The only thought I had was - A shoe with LOVE engraved!! CHEEEEEESY much? 🙉</p>

<p>There was one problem though. Nike Limited Edition shoes have a reputation of going out of stock within hours of the launch.
  Hence timing the purchase was going to be extremely crucial.</p>

<p> It was 1st Feb and I was expecting the sneaker to be launched by 6th of February. </p>

<p>Monitoring <a href="https://nike.com">Nike</a> continuously would have been time consuming and hence the first thing that struck me was -  If only  had a feature to notify about the launch 😓 </p>
<p>Not being able to find any viable solution to this, I took it upon myself to make one.</p>

<p>Firstly, I figured out if there's any difference between the pages of products available right now and the products yet to be launched!</p>

<div class="grid-container">

  <div class="grid-item"><img src="/assets/limited-edition-purchase/nike-in-stock.jpg"/><figcaption style="padding-top: 8px"> In Stock</figcaption></div>

  <div class="grid-item"><img src="/assets/limited-edition-purchase/nike-coming-soon.jpg" style="float:right"/><figcaption> Yet to be launched</figcaption></div>
</div>

<p> The visible difference is the text <b>Coming Soon</b> not being present in the product which is in stock.</p>

 <p> In HTML terms, this translated into a div with <i>data-text="comingSoon"`</i> not being present when product is in stock.</p>

<p> All I needed was a script which continuously scraped the page and check for the tag being present.
  The moment the product comes in stock, the tag would go away and in such case, a notification needed to be sent. </p>

<p> Wrote a python script to do the same.</p>

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fanmol1vw13%2Fscripts-py%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fnikeshoe_alerter.py&style=github&showFileMeta=on"></script>

<p> The script makes use of two external services</p>
<p> <a ref="https://www.callmebot.com/blog/free-api-whatsapp-messages/">Call Me Bot</a> for sending whatsapp messages.</p>
<p> <a ref="https://wirepusher.com/">Wirepusher</a> for sending mobile notifications.</p>
<p>The links have detailed description on how to set up both of them.</p>

<p>This script now had to be run on a machine and had to be run on regular intervals i.e. a cron had to be setup.</p>
<p>I chose <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">GCP</a> to be the cloud platform. You could follow <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/creating-a-virtual-machine-in-google-cloud-platform-ec2d74dbbab0">this</a> article to get it done.</p>

<p>Once the machine was up, I cloned the <a href="https://github.com/anmol1vw13/scripts-py">repository.</a></p>

<p> Only this left was to get the API Keys and set up a <a href="https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/create-a-cron-task-in-ubuntu-16-04/">cron</a> which ran every 2 minutes.</p>
<code style="padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 5px">
  */2 * * * * env MOBILE_NUMBER="#mobile_number" CALL_ME_BOT_KEY="#call_me_bot_key" WIRE_PUSHER_KEY="#wire_pusher_key" python /scripts-py/nikeshoe_alerter.py >> /log.py
</code>

<p style="padding-top: 15px;">All I now had to do was take the back seat and wait for the notification to arrive.👻</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I got her home address from her sister and asked her to keep it a surprise. Not a single word! Sssshhhhhh 🤭</p>
<p>Saved the address on nike to be swift like a cheetah during the sale 😎</p>
<p>Having waited for 6+ days, we lost complete hope about the gift being delivered on time, even if it became available.</p>
<p> Nevertheless, all of us at home were on cloud nine when the notification came up on 8th of Feb!! The rush to order it was crazy.</p>

</div>
<p>Making use of my programming skills to get ahead felt like an achievement!! Sure, a little over the top, but it did make me proud 🙊.</p>
<p>The shoe was arriving from Singapore and was being delivered by Aramex estimated to reach between 12th and 24th 🤐. Insane amount of buffer right?</p>
<p>I went through the procedure to get it customs cleared and to our luck, it got delivered right on time, on 14th morning.</p>
<p> The shoes were amazing, the box in which it came was even better. I have asked her to keep the box safe 😂.</p>
<p>She loved the sneakers, which made my first tech enabled valentine's day, although virtual, a huge success!!😋</p>
