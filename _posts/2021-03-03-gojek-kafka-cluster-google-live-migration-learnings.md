Recently, at Gojek, we faced a very peculiar issue related to kafka.

A lot of customers reported seeing untimely failures on producers and lag on consumers. 
This was like a nightmare which spanned for the last 2 weeks of February.üòê

When people dug deep and compared all the times this had happened over the past few weeks, 
they figured out migration of kafka broker(s) done by google to be the common event.

This wasn't a normal migration and rather a [live migration](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/live-migration), 
wherein the virtual machine instance is kept running and it is live migrated to another host on the same zone 
instead of requiring the VM to be rebooted. This article (https://blog.doit-intl.com/how-live-is-google-compute-engine-live-migration-f875e96ba923)
has more insights on live migration and the lag that takes place because of it.

Produce failures were of the following type

While, there were two types of consumers facing the lag
* Ones which auto-recovered after a while.
* Ones the streams of which shut down and a recovery meant restarting the service.

Why and how a live migration would be the culprit was still an big question mark! üëÄ

However, there were a few speculations as to how a misbehaving broker could cause lags in consumers
* Streams were stuck in re-balancing because one of the stream thread died and consumers 
using kafka client less than 2.3.0 could be facing issues because of it. Refer [KAFKA-7181](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7181)
* Consumers did not implement an UncaughtExceptionHandler and a encountering a Timeout Exception killed the thread. 
However this understanding was wrong as explained by a Confluent Engineer.

We had to, had to figure a way out!üôèüèª
   
But, before we proceed further, let's understand a few relevant kafka terminologies.
#### Parition Leaders and Replicas
Every partition, in ideal conditions is assigned a broker that acts as a leader and has zero or more brokers which 
act as replicas, governed by the replication factor. The leader handles all read and write requests for the partition
while the followers passively replicate the leader and remain in sync.

#### Controller
A controller is a broker. A cluster always has one controller present. In the events of the controller going down, zookeeper elects
a new controller for the cluster.  How does zookeeper do it?
Zookeeper always expects heartbeats to be sent from the all the brokers in the cluster 
and if a heartbeat isn't received with a certain interval, then the zookeeper assumes the broker to be non functional. 
(This interval is governed by ZOO_TICK_TIME which by default is 2000 ms) So, if the controller doesn't send a heartbeat
within ZOO_TICK_TIME ms, a controller election takes place.

Also, the controller's job description includes
 * Monitoring the health of all the other brokers in the cluster.
 * Mediate the leader election for a partition and announces this to the replicas.
 
#### Leader Election
For a kafka cluster to function properly, every partition needs to have a leader and in the events this leader 
isn't functional because of some failures, a new leader is selected from the in sync replica list 
Zookeeper is the one who gets to know about these failures which in turn signals them to the controller 
which then mediates an election.

#### Preferred Election
Preferred election is an election mediated by the controller to fix the uneven distribution of leaders for the topic.

### What did we do next?
Our team ziggurat had now entered the scene and we started discussing/debugging why this could be happening. Since we 
are the ones who build solutions on top of kafka's library, which is then used by the consumers, our finding and fixes
were extremely crucial! üòÖ

We started off going through the logs for the time intervals in which the consumers went down. Upon rigorous monitoring of 
all the affected consumers, we found out two prominent exceptions. 
* DisconnectException
    <pre class="block-code-pre">
    <code class="block-code-code">org.apache.kafka.clients.FetchSessionHandler:handleError: 
      [Consumer clientId=application_id_offset_reset_86be-ea18bbcf-c774-40e3-ba21-aedda1d16004-StreamThread-8-consumer, 
      groupId=application_id_offset_reset_86be] Error sending fetch request (sessionId=91025901, epoch=1235409) to node 1: 
      org.apache.kafka.common.errors.DisconnectException.</code>
    </pre>
* TimeoutException
  <pre class="block-code-pre">
  <code class="block-code-code">org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TimeoutException: Timeout of 60000ms expired before successfully committing offsets 
    {topic-5=OffsetAndMetadata{offset=1126387, leaderEpoch=null, metadata=''}}</code>
  </pre>
  For consumers whose stream threads died, we saw that the Timeout exception came up for a each partition, after which 
  the thread goes into ERROR state.
    
By now we also understood a little, how and why a live migration could cause this. 
A live migration was observed to have caused network failures on the broker which results in communication failure between
the controller and the broker. This leads to the broker getting kicked out the cluster.
A leader re-election takes place on those partitions for which the broker was a leader creating a leader imbalance in the cluster.
Once the broker is back up, it rejoins the cluster and the controller triggers a preferred election.

If this broker has a very high throughput, the preferred election leads to a delay in recovery and can cause the partition to be leader less
for several minutes. This has also been discussed in [KAFKA-4084](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-4084)
This would also lead to timeouts happening on consumer threads consuming from that partition. 

As you can see in the picture below, a maintenance had happened on g-gojek-id-mainstream-kafka-a-13 (Leader count dropped considerably)

The leader count went down at 12:36 and a recovery started by 12:40
During this period, a lot of consumers experienced a lag and a few didn't recover depending on how long it took for their topic partition to
overcome the imbalance.

<figcaption>Leader count chart, which is a summation of all partitions.</figcaption>
</div></div>

So, the next task in hand was to reproduce it on local or integration, so that we could try various kafka configuration settings in order to
mitigate the issue. 
Only caveat was that we might not get accurate results because of the variance in load when compared to production.

To speed up, we split into two pods
* The first one focused on reproducing the issue on the local machine
* The second one put all their efforts on reading through the documentation to figure out the best suited kafka consumer 
configurations which could help.

### Local Reproduction 

Since we already had a docker setup of 1 kafka broker and 1 zookeeper, we thought of starting off with that.

Steps and observations:
* Ran the kafka-zookeeper docker setup locally.
* Produced messages into kafka.
* Ran a consumer locally, with bootstrap-server pointed to local kafka/
* Observed that the consumer started message consumption.
* After a while, stopped the container which was running kafka.
* Observed DisconnectException and TimeoutException in the consumer logs but also observed that the stream thread 
didn't die even after waiting for 20 minutes. 
* After bringing the broker back, the consumer started consuming messages by itself.
Also found a similar kafka issue [KAFKA-3468](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3468) which tells that 
consumers do not fail on such scenarios and rather try to fetch the metadata in a loop, forever. 

Because we didn't see any issue with the above setup, we thought of moving on to something better. 
Since our production environment runs a kafka cluster, we decided to go ahead with similar setup. 
Figuring out the details of setting up a cluster locally, sure took some time, but we got it sorted.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/anmol1vw13/ee90d728b6d92d74b5e4a3e632f4d76e.js"></script>

To reproduce the issue, we just needed to ensure the partition had no leader for a while and re-election couldn't took place.

So basically, if the leader is down and the controller is not able to elect a new leader, the partition would become 
leader less which in turn could lead to Timeout Exceptions on the consumer assigned to that partition.

The immediate question was how does a controller know when it has to trigger an election? Like we discussed above, zookeeper is
the one that signals it to controller. Hence the next step was to block communications from zookeeper to controller.
Blocking the communication is as simple as adding an IP table rule in the controller to block all requests from zookeeper.

But you might say that if zookeeper isn't able to reach the controller, it would elect a new one, right? 

Well, you might have figured an answer to this already.

Yes you are right, it's `ZOO_TICK_TIME`! If this configuration is increased to a huge number, then even 
zookeeper wouldn't know if the controller isn't functional and hence new one wouldn't be elected. Smart, right? üòÜ

    <figcaption>The eureka moment üòé</figcaption>
  </div>
</div>
  
Because we cannot have high throughput like production on the local environment, going the preferred election route wasn't possible.

Hence, to reproduce the issue, implementing the above idea made more sense.

Following are the steps and observations
* Create a cluster using the docker-compose file mentioned above, 
  ensuring `ZOO_TICK_TIME` in zookeeper configuration to be of a very high value, say 600000
* Create a topic with 3 partitions and 12 replica count using the kafka-topics
    <pre class="block-code-pre">
    <code class="block-code-code">./kafka-topics.sh --create --topic topic-x --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 3 --partitions 12</code></pre>
* Produce messages into `topic-x`
* Run a consumer consuming from the topic specified above and see that it‚Äôs consuming the messages
* Find the kafka controller‚Äôs broker id by running the following command using zookeeper shell 
    <pre class="block-code-pre">
    <code class="block-code-code">./zookeeper-shell.sh localhost:2181 << get /controller</code></pre>
* Exec into the broker's container found above and put a rule in the iptables to not accept requests from zookeeper
   <pre class="block-code-pre">
       <code class="block-code-code">iptables -A INPUT -s <zookeeper_ip> -j DROP</zookeeper_ip></code></pre>
* Observe that the new controller isn't elected even after waiting for 5 mins. Kudos to high value of ZOO_TICK_TIME.
* Find a partition the leader of which isn‚Äôt the controller. This can be found using kafka-topics
    <pre class="block-code-pre">
    <code class="block-code-code">./kafka-topics.sh --describe --topic topic-x --bootstrap-server localhost:9091</code></pre>
* Stop that broker using docker stop <container_id>  (Container Id can be figured out using `docker ps -a`)
* Keep monitoring the actor‚Äôs logs. We‚Äôll see disconnect & offset commit timeout exceptions. 
In about 5-10 mins the streams will shutdown.
* Getting the leader back up didn't restart the message consumption either.

### Resolution

Let's go through all the configurations that the other team believed this issue could be solved with.

* retries
* session.timeout.ms
* default.api.timeout.ms

`retries` - The number of retries for broker requests that return a retryable error. 
Since DisconnectException and TimeoutException are both, a type of Retryable error, 
we thought configuring retries to a high value would solve it. 

`session.timeout.ms` - The timeout used to detect client failures when using Kafka's group management facility. 
The client sends periodic heartbeats to indicate its aliveness to the broker.
If no heartbeats are received by the broker before the expiration of this session timeout, 
then the broker will remove this client from the group and initiate a re-balance. 

`default.api.timeout.ms` - This configuration is used as the default timeout for all client operations 
that do not specify a timeout parameter. Since we didn't find any configuration with respect to offset commit timeout,
we believed the default api timeout would be in use for offset commit as well.

Before starting experimentation with the configurations, we also set an [UncaughtExceptionHandler](https://kafka.apache.org/10/documentation/streams/developer-guide/write-streams#using-kafka-streams-within-your-application-code), 
and added a log just to gauge the exception which causes stream to die.

Jotting down our observations with respect to each of the configs.

`retries` - Retries somehow didn't have any effect on the the timeout. We observed that the number of times we received
the timeout exception on a consumer is always equal to the number of partitions irrespective of the 
number retries was configured to.

`session.timeout.ms` - In our case since the consumer was shutting down completely, session didn't matter and hence 
this config didn't help at all.

`default.api.timeout.ms` - We observed that if the value of this config is greater than the time it takes for the cluster to stabilize, the streams
do not die and start consuming messages once things come back to normal.

Knowing that default.api.timeout.ms worked, we tested it out on integration and intimated all the stakeholders about it.

Apart from figuring out the right consumer config, we realized that since live migration is the one creating all the fuss,
we also updated the [migration policy](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/setting-instance-scheduling-options#schedulingoptions) from migrateOnHostMaintenance to terminateOnHostMaintenance and also set compute.instances.automaticRestart
to be true. Shutdown and restart would mean a faster preferred election.
Since Kafka is and highly available setup, one broker being down for a few minutes wouldn't have much effect.

Thus after a week of rigorous effort, we were able to figure out a viable solution!

### The positives
The last week of February was THE WEEK where we got to learn a lot about kafka. This was also the week, were the whole team
paired together all the time which in turn contributed to strengthening the bond. 
Kudos to such production issues!! ü§™
