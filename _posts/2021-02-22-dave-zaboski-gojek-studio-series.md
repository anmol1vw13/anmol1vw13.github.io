<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davezaboski/">Dave Zaboski's</a> talk was the first one in the Studio speaker series at <b>Gojek.</b>

He is a classically trained painter, illustrator and former Senior Animator with Disney, Sony and Warner Bros.
He has drawn for such classic films as Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, the Lion King, Pocahontas,
The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules, Tarzan, The Emperor's New Groove, Fantasia 2000 and more.

His talk was impressive since his presentation was on Photoshop! Mind equals Blown right?
It was inspiring particularly for the designers.

Let's begin with the notes.

* Turn a thought into a thing and you meander into multiple things before reaching the thing
which is sort of a gap between where you are where you want to reach.

* Creative path isn't a straight line that takes you from thought to thing, but you cultivate practices that help you land to the thing in a spiral path.

* What's my why? Why am I at Gojek?

* Learn to live in the space of iterations. Don't get frustrated when you can't make a perfect line but if you can build upto it,
that's awesome too.

* Plussing - Being in service to the trajectory of the idea. Enter into a trajectory conversation i.e ask yourself and the people around these questions.
  1. Where has the idea come from?
  1. Where are you going?
  1. Where are you at now?

    Always say YES AND?


* Fastest way towards personal excellence is collaborating generously.
* Invite risk with practices that make it less risky. Risk increases our attentiveness.
* Don't think about things as faulure, think about it as data collection.
* Creators follow the acronym BRICC i.e
1. Believe
1. Iterate
1. Collaborate
1. Risk     -----> Trust
1. Complete -----> Finish strong

    You tell a story when you complete!!

* Every crisis that earth has ever faced has been solved by profound acts of creativity.
* Share your creativity with someone to service a story that's bigger than anyone.
* Are you too hot or too cold when you work on a project?
* How do we complete things? At some point, we declare it complete. Sometimes you need someone to tell you that it's complete and also judge the diminishing return
  #finishednotperfect and Done is better than perfect.
* Self expression is more important than branding.
* Power of creation comes from  "Knowing thy self". How you look shouldn't matter.
* Innovation is purposeful creation.
* How do you achieve the impossible?
By creating something which is `impossible - 1` i.e. figure out what that `impossible - 1` is, which could be a stepping stone towards achieving the impossible.
