<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br/>Shivagange urf Dakshina Kashi, is at a distance of 65km from
  Bangalore. With its great religious significance, one can see numerous shrines of&nbsp; Parvati, Shiva, and Nandi,
  throughout the trek.<br/>The name â€˜Shivagangeâ€™ is an amalgamation of two words â€“ Shiva and Gange. The hillock looks
  like a <b>Shivalingam</b> when seen from one of the sides with a temple of Lord Shiva situated at the summit of the
  hill. There is also a spring nearby that is locally called <b>Gange</b>, whose water is believed to be
  sacred.<br/><br/>

  <br/><br/><b><i>Baseline</i></b><br/>Crew members: Anmol, Sudhanv<br/>Time: 5AM<br/>Transportation: Sudhanv's i20<br/><br/>As
  usual, I started asking around by Wednesday. This time around, apart from me and Ponkishore, I had 3 new people who
  wanted to come along (Sudhanv, Anirudh and Vijay). We didn't have to book a car either because Sudhanv had one
  ($aving$$$$$$ ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘)<br/>The place I had initially chosen was Bhairavi Durga. The trail of it is pretty steep and
  you've to have done a lot of trekking to tread such path. I changed the spot to Shivagange since most of them didn't
  have prior trekking experience.<br/><br/><b>Getting there</b><br/><b><br/></b>So, the plan was to gather at Sudhanv's
  place by 4:30 AM which was when we were scheduled to leave.<br/>Waking up at 3:30, the first thing I saw was a message
  from Ponkishore saying he wouldn't be able to come because he had a long night at the office.&nbsp;I have to admit, my
  motivation came down too since I didn't sleep much either.<br/>I called up Sudhanv next. He picked the call and said
  he was ready.<br/>That got me charged up! Hell, yeah.<br/><br/>Anirudh picked and was sorry saying - '<i>I know, Galti
    Meri Hai, but Mein Nahi Aa Paaoonga Kyunki Ghar Pe impromptu house party Rakhi Thi</i>' ðŸ™‰<br/><br/>Vijay didn't
  even pick. He called while we were on the trek and had the lamest excuse ever - '<i>Bhai, phone airplane mode pe Chala
    Gaya Tha'</i> ðŸ™ˆ<br/><br/>So, from 5 we were down to just the 2 of us but we still decided to go for it.<br/>I
  reached Sudhanv's place at 4:50 and we hit the road by 5.<br/><br/>

  <br/>Driving a hatchback, after an SUV can be a bit tricky. The controls aren't very smooth.<br/>I drove for a bit but
  then gave the wheels back to Sudhanv.<br/><br/>We reached by 6:30. It is a quiet village with lots of monkeys
  around.<br/>The trek begins with an&nbsp;entry to the famous Girigangadhareshwara &amp; Honnadevi Temple. The initial
  climb had about 200 steps. By the time we reached the temple, Sudhanv had realized he's gotta start working out.
  Hahaha.<br/><br/>

  <br/><br/>We then met a man, who apparently, had been coming on the same trek for the past 18 days for spiritual
  reasons.&nbsp;He knew a great deal about the place but because he was speaking in Kannada I couldn't grasp much of it
  (Sudhanv however, found a good friend in him).<br/><br/>The man then stopped at a spot that had a statue of Lord
  Shiva's with little water around. He drank some of it, saying the water is holy and is believed to cure diseases.<br/><br/>

  <br/>With a lot of short breaks and an hour into the trek, we reached a small Ganesha temple, with idols of Shiva,
  Parvati, and Nandi.<br/><br/>

  <br/>The final ascent was quite tricky and challenging. Without a good pair of shoes, you might end up bruising
  yourself.<br/><br/>

  The steps were extremely steep, and after much trudging, we finally reached the top by 8:30. The breeze was better
  than all the places I had been to (<i>Naa Kam, Naa Zyaada</i>).<br/><br/>There's also a stall, in case you need to
  re-energize yourself. Fruit chat, Bhelpuri, Sevpuri, Chips, Buttermilk, Cucumber are few of the eatables, the stall
  had to offer.<br/>I had a cucumber - super refreshing.<br/>

  Although a bit crowded, this place did have a few spots where one could find peace. I found one for myself and
  meditated for about 40 minutes.<br/><br/>

  <br/>All through the trek, we were accompanied by monkeys &amp; they attacked anyone with eatables. Hence it is a good
  idea to trek the hills without any edible stuff in your hands.<br/><br/>

  <br/>We stayed on the top for about an hour and a half after which we started our descent. It felt like a stroll in
  the park and we covered the path in just an hour. So, it took us around 3 hours, to and fro and I felt like a pro
  (Aye, that rhymes!ðŸ˜‹).<br/><br/>The folks at the temple were having some sort of langar and were insisting all the
  trekkers to eat something before leaving. They had served tomato rice and a dessert which was made of rice. It was
  fillingðŸ˜…<br/><br/>We drove back to Bangalore. I had lunch at Sudhanv's place. Aunty had prepared <i>PavBhaji, Gobi Ke
    Paranthe, and Rasagulla.&nbsp;</i><br/>The food was very tasty. After the hearty lunch and some much-needed rest, I
  got back to my place and slept like a baby!<br/><br/>I would rate the trek to be moderately difficult and would also
  recommend to visit it at least once.<br/><br/>Happy Trekking! :)<br/><br/></div>
